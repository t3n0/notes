# A clickable link that directly starts the download

We have a file in a repository that we want to share. For example, this very same [markdown file](https://github.com/t3n0/notes/blob/b0afa7e5cdcdca54884927cce8508cb94e91e752/other/download-link.md).\
By clicking the above link, we will just move to that specific github page.
