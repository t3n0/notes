# A clickable link that directly starts the download

We have a file in a repository that we want to share. For example, this very same.\

Permalink vs main link:

[some commit](https://github.com/t3n0/notes/blob/d33b2b3bd67efc3fce4f65ef4116f31ca5fbcddd/other/download-link.md)\
[main](https://github.com/t3n0/notes/blob/main/other/download-link.md)

By clicking the above link, we will just move to that specific github page.
