# Link to main VS permalink to commit

Github offers several ways of linking the URL of a file:
1. a link pointing to the HEAD of a branch (generally `main`)
2. a permalink pointing to a specific `commit`

## HEAD link

This very same markdown file has the `main` HEAD at the URL:

https://github.com/t3n0/notes/blob/main/other/permalink.md

This is just the URL shown above in the navigation bar of the browser.

## Permalink

By pressing `y` (or navigating to the `copy permalink` option) while inspecting any file or commit on github one can generate the corresponding permalink.
For example, the following is the permalink of a previous commit of this very same `permalink.md` file:

https://github.com/t3n0/notes/blob/2068d17342171256158456836210e6e250e5cbed/other/permalink.md
