# Notebooks

This a collection of jupyter notebooks made by [me](https://github.com/t3n0). It includes little projects, routines and physics lectures and excercises.
Some of them can be [binderized](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/t3n0/notebooks/HEAD) and are ready to be used (loading binder takes a little time, don't despare).
Others probabily lack of the necessary dependencies/widgets to properly been rendered on binder. Just download and try to run them locally.
